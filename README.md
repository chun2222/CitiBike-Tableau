# Tableau Homework - Citi Bike Analytics

## Background

![Citi-Bikes](Images/citi-bike-station-bikes.jpg)

Congratulations on your new job! As the new lead analyst for the [New York Citi Bike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Bike) Program, you are now responsible for overseeing the largest bike sharing program in the United States. In your new role, you will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have a number of questions on the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

## Task

**This assignment is to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomena.**

**Design multiple visualizations for each discovered phenomena.**

**A dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year). Again, with zip code data overlaid on the map.**

**Create a Tableau story that brings together the visualizations, requested maps, and dashboards.**
